# 💡 Exercism Elixir Solutions

This repository contains my personal solutions to the [Elixir track on Exercism.org](https://exercism.org/tracks/elixir). Each folder corresponds to a specific exercise and includes my working code, tests, and occasional notes or alternative approaches.

## 🚀 Purpose

- Track my progress through the Exercism Elixir track
- Reflect on learning and refactor as I improve
- Serve as a backup and reference for future projects

## 📦 Structure

```
solutions/elixir/
├── hello-world/
│   └── lib/
│   └── test/
└── ...
```

Each folder is named after the exercise and includes the code provided by Exercism along with my solution and tests.

## 🧪 Running Tests

Make sure you have Elixir installed, then run the tests for any exercise like so:

```bash
cd <exercise-name>
mix test
```

## 📝 Notes

These solutions reflect my current understanding of Elixir and functional programming. I may revisit and improve them as I learn more.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

These solutions are intended for personal learning. If you're working through Exercism yourself, try to solve the problems on your own before referring to other code — including this one.

## 📚 About Exercism
